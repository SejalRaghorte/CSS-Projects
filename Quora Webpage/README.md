<h1> Quora Webpage </h1>
<p>
  This project is a basic replica of the Quora webpage, designed using HTML and CSS to simulate a question-answer interface. It mimics the essential structure and 
   components of Quora's interface, including:

<ul>
  <li> A header section with "Log in" and "Sign up" buttons. </li>
  <li> Navigation links for different sections like Home, Following, Answer, and Spaces. </li>
  <li> A main section featuring questions with options to upvote, follow, or answer. </li>
</ul>
</p>
